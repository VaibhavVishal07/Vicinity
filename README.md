# Vicinity
A python based app which lets you transfer files within computers in the same network, using Simple Hand Gestures.

This is a hobby project created along with my friends YashParikh and AnubhavArukia. You can improve the code or provide suggestions but using the code for any kind of commercial or private use without prior permission will be considered as copyright breach.

To use the application, first create a directory in C drive called "VICINITY".
Copy contents of zip package to c:/VICINITY and you're ready to run the app.

Run the run.exe file in both the sender and receiver computer, make sure that both computers are connected to the same wifi or hotspot.
Click "Receive" on the receiving computer.. on the sending computer, copy files to send folder and then click on send.

The app will dynamically connect the two computers and then open the camera terminal in both the computers. Do a "Grab" gesture on the sender computer and with a "Release" gesture, drop the files into the receiver pc.
